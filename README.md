# Transcorder

Quick and handy dictaphone app, that uses the Microsoft Azure Cognitive speach services to transcribe a section of speach recorded via the default audio input device.
After interpreting the audio, it appends the recognized text into the output file (if given) and also copies its value onto the clipboard for later use.
